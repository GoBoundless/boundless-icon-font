This is an automated system to develop an icon webfont from all .svg files present in the "svg" folder.

It uses "fontCustom"
https://github.com/FontCustom/fontcustom

Design guidelines:
-All colors will be rendered identically — including white fills.
-Make transparent colors solid. SVGs with transparency will be skipped.
-For greater precision, prefer fills to strokes (especially if your icon includes curves).
-Keep your icon within a square viewBox. Font Custom scales each SVG to fit a 512x512 canvas with a baseline at 448.
-Setting autowidth to true trims horizontal white space from each glyph. This can be much easier than centering dozens of SVGs by hand.


Installation:
brew install fontforge eot-utils ttfautohint
gem install fontcustom
brew install node


USAGE:
1. CD to this directory, then Run:
node start.js
(will watch the svg folder for new files)

2. Add, or remove .svg files to/from the svg folder, and the css, and font will be automatically updated

3. Visit the styleguide folder to preview your font in the browser.

4. To move the updated font into the Boundless app, copy the folders “stylesheets” and “boundless-icon-font” from this folder into www/lib/assets/fonts/icon-font


Notes:
-Config file is: fontcustom.yml. These config settings will only be loaded if the fontcustom command is run while in this directory
-If you run "node start.js" and the svg folder is empty, it will error and exit.
